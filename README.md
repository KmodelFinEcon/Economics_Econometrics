This repository houses a comprehensive collection of stochastic process algorithms and econometric models tailored for computational finance applications. 
It includes implementations of key stochastic methods such as Brownian motion, Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM), Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes, and jump-diffusion models, which are fundamental in derivative pricing
and financial simulations.

Additionally, the repository features a variety of macroeconomic and microeconomic models commonly employed in industry and academic research. These include:

-Time-series econometrics (ARIMA, GARCH, VAR) for forecasting and volatility modeling.
-Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models for macroeconomic policy analysis.
-Agent-based models (ABMs) and discrete choice models for market behavior simulations.
-Monte Carlo methods and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques for Bayesian econometrics.
-Machine learning, LSTM, conformal prediction and Random forest predictors for asset class movement.

The implementations are designed for efficiency, scalability, and ease of integration into quantitative finance & economics workflows.
